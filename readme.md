Travelog is an Android application developed in Android Studio using Java, XML, and SQLite. It's designed to help you organize and store photos from your vacations. The app lets you sort your pictures into categories, which can represent anything from a specific day of your trip to an event during your vacation. A key feature is the ability to save a single photo into multiple categories, making it easy to find and reference your memories.

### **Travelog: Your Personal Vacation Photo Organizer**

**Travelog** is an Android application built with **Java**, **XML**, and **SQLite** to help you efficiently store and organize photos from your trips. The app's core feature is its ability to categorize your photos, allowing you to create custom albums for specific days, events, or experiences from your vacation.

For example, on a trip to Los Angeles, you could create categories for "Car Museum" or "Archery Lessons." Each category would contain photos related to that specific activity. The app also allows you to add a single photo to multiple categories, so a special memory could be saved under both "Archery Lessons" and a "Favorites" category, making it easier to find later.

**This powerful categorization system lets you quickly find and relive your memories without scrolling through hundreds of unsorted pictures in your main photo gallery.**

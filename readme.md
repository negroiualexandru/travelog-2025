**Travelog** is a native Android application designed to solve the chaos of unsorted vacation photos. Built with **Java** and **SQLite**, it empowers users to organize memories into custom, flexible categories. Unlike standard galleries that sort only by date, Travelog allows for thematic organization—letting you group photos by specific events, locations, or experiences.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Custom Categorization:** Create specific albums for parts of your trip (e.g., *"Car Museum"*, *"Archery Lessons"*, *"Day 1 in LA"*).
* **Multi-Tagging System:** A single photo can belong to multiple categories simultaneously. A group selfie can live in both *"Family"* and *"Beach Day"* without duplicating the file.
* **Offline First:** Utilizing **SQLite** for local storage, the app is fully functional without an internet connection—perfect for travel in remote areas.
* **High-Contrast UI:** Designed with accessibility in mind, featuring clear button labels and high-contrast visuals for easy navigation in bright sunlight.
